- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/poll_timer.js.
- Will the order of execution change if the delay in the while loop is changed from 10s to 150s? Why or why not?
- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?

If the delay increases it does not affect the execution order, 
only the delay increases because blocking takes up the time loop.
But if the delay is reduced to 0. 
But because there is no delay may cause setTimeout's callback function to execute before someAsyncOperation's callback.
