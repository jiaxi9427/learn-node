- In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.
The code first defines a function named someAsyncOperation that asynchronously reads a file from the file system. 
Then I define another function called foo, which simply prints out "foo". 
Next, call the someAsyncOperation function, followed by the foo function, and print out "done".
Because fs.readFile in someAsyncOperation is executed asynchronously, it does not complete immediately,
but executes its callback function at some point in time after the file read operation is finished.
