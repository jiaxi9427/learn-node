- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/immediate.js.
- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?

If the delay of setTimeout is changed to 0, its callback function will theoretically be added to the event queue as early as possible, 
but since it is still declared in the callback of the file read, the actual execution time will be after the current macro task (file read fetch call) has completed. 
This means that setImmediate is still executed after the setTimeout callback, because setImmediate is designed to be executed immediately after the polling phase of the current event loop, 
and setTimeout, even if the delay is 0, may be executed later due to other activity in the event loop.
